@ManyToOne
@OneToMany

when you use @ManyToOne annotation it creates column in d.b

-> when you @ManyToOne annotation you have to use @JoinColumn like below 

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name="doctor_id")
private List<Doctor> doctor;

if you won't mention @JoinColumn then in d.b it creates that field like below
doctor.doctor_id(className.Id)

when you use @OneToMany annotation it doesn't creates column in d.b (check once)

I think you should mention like below
@OneToMany(maapedBy="doctor")
private List<Appointment> appointment;

class Doctor{

@Id
@Column("doctor_id")
private Integer id;

@OneToMany(maapedBy="doctor")
private List<Appointment> appointment;

}

class Appointment{

private Integer id;

@ManyToOne
@JoinColumn(name="doctor_id")
private List<Doctor> doctor;

}
