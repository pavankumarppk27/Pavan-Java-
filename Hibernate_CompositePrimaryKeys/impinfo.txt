@IdClass
@Embeddable
@EmbeddedId

every key should implement Serializable Interface.


IdClass vs Embeddable

IdClass:
=======
if we use IdClass we have to repeat id,email two times(Customer,CustoerId classes).
and readability also missing in Customer Entity classes.
But while writing queries directly we can write query lik below
===>select c.email Customer c;

Embeddable:
==========
which gives readability.

But while writing queries directly we can write query lik below
===>select c.CustomerId.email Customer c;
